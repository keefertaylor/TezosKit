/**
 * TezosClient is the gateway into the Tezos Network.
 *
 * Configuration
 * -------------
 * The client is initialized with a node URL which points to a node who can receive JSON RPC
 * requests from this client. The default not is rpc.tezrpc.me, a public node provided by TezTech.
 *
 * RPCs
 * -------------
 * TezosClient contains support for GET and POST RPCS and will make requests based on the
 * RPCs provided to it.
 *
 * All supported RPC operations are provided in the Sources/Requests folder of the project. In
 * addition, TezosClient provides convenience methods for constructing and sending all supported
 * operations.
 *
 * Clients who extend TezosKit functionality can send arbitrary RPCs by creating an RPC object that
 * conforms the the |TezosRPC| protocol and calling:
 *      func send<T>(rpc: TezosRPC<T>)
 *
 * Operations
 * -------------
 * TezosClient also contains support for performing signed operations on the Tezos blockchain. These
 * operations require a multi-step process to perform (forge, sign, pre-apply, inject).
 *
 * All supported signed operations are provided in the Sources/Operations folder of the project. In
 * addition, TezosClient provides convenience methods for constructing and performing all supported
 * signed operations.
 *
 * Operations are sent with a fee and a limit for gas and storage to use to include the transaction
 * on the blockchain. These parameters are encapsulated in an OperationFees object which is optionally passed
 * to operation objects. Operations will fall back to default fees if no custom fees are provided.
 *
 * Clients who extend TezosKit functionality can send arbitrary signed operations by creating an
 * Operation object that conforms to the |Operation| protocol and calling:
 *      func forgeSignPreapplyAndInjectOperation(operation: Operation,
 *                                               source: String,
 *                                               keys: Keys,
 *                                               completion: @escaping (String?, Error?) -> Void)
 *
 * Clients can also send multiple signed operations at once by constructing an array of operations.
 * Operations are applied in the order they are given in the array. Clients should pass the array
 * to:
 *      func forgeSignPreapplyAndInjectOperations(operations: [Operation],
 *                                                source: String,
 *                                                keys: Keys,
 *                                                completion: @escaping (String?, Error?) -> Void)
 *
 * Some signed operations require an address be revealed in order to complete the operation. For
 * operations supported in TezosKit, the reveal operation will be automatically applied when needed.
 * For clients who create their own custom signed operations, TezosKit will apply the reveal
 * operation correctly as long as the |requiresReveal| bit on the custom Operation object is set
 * correctly.
