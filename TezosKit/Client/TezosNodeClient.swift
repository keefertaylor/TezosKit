/// TezosNodeClient is the gateway into the Tezos Network via a Tezos Node.
///
/// Configuration
/// -------------
/// The client is initialized with a node URL which points to a node who can receive JSON RPC
/// requests from this client. The default not is rpc.tezrpc.me, a public node provided by TezTech.
///
/// The client can be initialized with a custom URLSession can be provided to manage network requests. By default, the
/// shared URLSession is used.
///
/// The client can also be initialized with a custom DispatchQueue that all callbacks are called on. By default, the
/// main dispatch queue is used.
///
/// RPCs
/// -------------
/// TezosNodeClient contains support for GET and POST RPCS and will make requests based on the
/// RPCs provided to it.
///
/// All supported RPC operations are provided in the Sources/Requests folder of the project. In
/// addition, TezosNodeClient provides convenience methods for constructing and sending all supported
/// operations.
///
/// Clients who extend TezosKit functionality can send arbitrary RPCs by creating an RPC object that
/// conforms the the |RPC| protocol and calling:
///     func send<T>(RPC<T>, completion: (T, Error) -> Void)
///
/// Operations
/// -------------
/// TezosNodeClient also contains support for performing signed operations on the Tezos blockchain. These
/// operations require a multi-step process to perform (forge, sign, pre-apply, inject).
///
/// All supported signed operations are provided in the Sources/Operations folder of the project. In
/// addition, TezosNodeClient provides convenience methods for constructing and performing all supported
/// signed operations.
///
/// Operations are sent with a fee and a limit for gas and storage to use to include the transaction
/// on the blockchain. These parameters are encapsulated in an OperationFees object which is optionally passed
/// to operation objects. Operations will fall back to default fees if no custom fees are provided.
///
/// Clients who extend TezosKit functionality can send arbitrary signed operations by creating an
/// Operation object that conforms to the |Operation| protocol and calling:
///     func forgeSignPreapplyAndInjectOperation(
///       _ operation: Operation,
///       source: Address,
///       keys: Keys,
///       completion: @escaping (String?, Error?) -> Void
///     )
///
/// Clients can also send multiple signed operations at once by constructing an array of operations.
/// Operations are applied in the order they are given in the array. Clients should pass the array
/// to:
///     func forgeSignPreapplyAndInjectOperations(
///       _ operations: [Operation],
///       source: Address,
///       keys: Keys,
///       completion: @escaping (String?, Error?) -> Void
///     )
///
/// Some signed operations require an address be revealed in order to complete the operation. For
/// operations supported in TezosKit, the reveal operation will be automatically applied when needed.
/// For clients who create their own custom signed operations, TezosKit will apply the reveal
/// operation correctly as long as the |requiresReveal| bit on the custom Operation object is set
/// correctly.
