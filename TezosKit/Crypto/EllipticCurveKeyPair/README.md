# Elliptic Curve Key Pair

This library was imported from [agens-no/EllipticCurveKeyPair](https://github.com/agens-no/EllipticCurveKeyPair) on Feb 07, 2020. The library has received updates but was last released (via both GitHub Tags / Carthage and CocoaPods) in November 2017. While Carthage would allow consumption of a fork of the library, CocoaPods requires the owner to publish it. There have been regular updates to this repo, so publishing a new CocoaPods version / forking for Carthage feels less than useful. 

## Imported Files

This folder contains the contents of the `Sources/` folder. Headers of the files indicate the commit hash they were imported at.  

## Tracking a new Release

If a new version of EllipticCurveKeyPair is released, this library should move to consuming the code as a dependency. [Issue 48](https://github.com/agens-no/EllipticCurveKeyPair/issues/48) tracks this request.
